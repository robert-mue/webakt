Reference manual xxxx
Obsolete
This folder has now been renamed "User manual", to better indicate that it is concerned with how users can work with webAKT.  See the Property > Notes for the "User manual" folder for more information.

Tutorial 1 - viewing KB
This folder contains the document for the webAKT Tutorial 1 - viewing KB.  This tutorial is modelled on Chapter 13 - A quick sightseeing tour around AKT in the AKT5 Manual, adapted for changes in the webaKT user interface and some re-ordering of content.
This tutorial was used by Tim Pagella in the MSc teaching in Bangor in February 202- 2024.

Tutorial 2 -creating KB
This folder contains the document for the webAKT Tutorial 2 - creating KB.    This is based on the sample data and procedures used in the AKT5 Manual, Chapter 14 - A tutorial in creating a simple knowledge base, adapted for differences in the webAKT user interface and functionality, and with some re-ordering of the contents.

User Manual
The webAKT User Manual Covers all aspects of the user interface for working with webAKT.    This includes creating, viewing and processing knowledge bases, including working with diagrams and tools.   It thus approximates to the content of the following chapters in the AKT5 Manual:
Chapter 7   - Software manual for AKT
Chapter 8   - The diagram interface
Chapter 9   - Reasoning with AKT tools
Chapter 11  - Incorporating pictures and diagrams into the knowledge base

Note that it does not include a section that corresponds to Chapter 10 - Creating your own tools, since  (currently) in webAKT tools are implemented in JavaScript: there is (currently) no equivalent of the Task Language in webAKT.

Technical
Technical aspects of webAKT (which basically means anything that involves workng with HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript) are not touched on in the User Manual, but are dealt with in separate manuals.
