    CHAPTER FOURTEEN – TUTORIAL IN CREATING A
                            SIMPLE KNOWLEDGE BASE
This tutorial guides you through the creation of a small knowledge base and then invites you
to try out different ways of exploring it. The knowledge represented is abstracted from Bandy,
D.E., Garrity, D.P. and Sanchez, P.A. (1993) The worldwide problem of slash-and-burn
agriculture. Agroforestry Today Vol. 5 (3), 2-6. The tutorial is only an introduction to AKT;
please use chapters 7 – 12 to guide you when you require further information on AKT
facilities.
14.1 OPENING AKT
Open the AKT application. An introductory title page will appear. Press OK. A new screen
will appear with a series of menus in the top left-hand section. Select KB. In the ensuing
drop-down menu, select New KB, give your new knowledge base an appropriate name (e.g.
slash_and_burn) and save it.
Now that you have an empty knowledge base prepared to receive information, we will
address the text on which your knowledge base is to be based.
14.2 KNOWLEDGE FROM THE SOURCE
For the purposes of this tutorial, we will make use of the following text as our source
knowledge. It may be more usual however, for source knowledge to be a tape-recorded
interview. The following are extracts from the source text:
               “...burning helps to control pests and diseases....the higher soil
               temperatures that follow clearing and burning also accelerate the
               decomposition of organic matter in the top layers of the soil.
               About half of the nitrogen and phosphorus in the burnt material and
               nearly all the remaining nutrients are released to the soil from the ash
               after burning. These nutrients are flushed from the ash by the rain
               and have the effect of raising the pH of the upper layers of soil as well
               as incorporating the nutrients. Nutrients in concentrated form are thus
               available for one or two years after clearing. The quantity and quality
               of these nutrients depends on the native fertility of the soil...
               Crops such as corn, rice, beans, cassava, yams and plantains are
               then planted....
               As nutrients are removed by crop harvests or lost through leaching,
               soil fertility declines. At the same time, the relatively easily removed
               broad-leaved weeds are replaced by harder to manage grasses and
               increasing weed density quickly impedes further cropping. The fields
               are then abandoned for a period of fallow.
               The secondary forest grows rapidly during the fallow, using nutrients
               remaining in the soil...Essential minerals (phosphorus, potassium,
               calcium, etc.) are extracted from lower soil layers during regrowth and
               brought to the surface by trees....
               Soil erosion... is seldom a problem in shifting cultivation because the
               cleared areas are small and are always covered by some sort of
               vegetation. When unsustainable slash-and-burn is practised by
               newcomers, however, the soil is sometimes left uncovered. This can
               lead to major erosion problems, particularly in hilly areas.....
Tutorials                                        155
Chapter Fourteen – Tutorial in creating a simple knowledge base
               When the soil is bare and erosion a problem, the siltation rate of the
               waterways is increased and this often has a negative effect upon
               aquatic life forms and fish production.
               Neither are weeds a difficulty in the traditional method because the
               land is left to fallow as soon as they become a problem. In the
               subsequent fallow period, weeds soon die out as the crown of the
               secondary forest closes. Migrant farmers, however, will remove all
               vegetation and the roots and stumps of the felled trees from the areas
               they clear for intensive farming.
               These practices mean that when the land is finally abandoned there
               are no rootstocks left from which the trees may grow and grasses are
               the most common invaders of the open areas. This means that
               clearing of land by migrant farmers generally results in the permanent
               destruction of the rain forest.”
The intention behind creating a knowledge base in AKT is to represent knowledge that
provides a description of the ecology of a particular agroforestry practice. This is achieved by
abstracting a set of unitary statements from the source knowledge that, as a set, represent a
coherent description of the ecology of the practice. This process of breaking down the source
knowledge into a set of unitary statements may demand considerable interpretation. Relying
too literally on the exact statements in the source knowledge will tend to result in many
statements in the knowledge base that become very difficult to interpret.
Consider, for example:
               “In the subsequent fallow period, weeds soon die out as the crown of
               the secondary forest closes.”
A literal abstraction of information might result in the statements that:
               “Weeds soon die out in the fallow period”
               “Weeds die out when the crown of the secondary forest closes”
Both statements are fairly literal abstractions and superficially reasonable and useful.
However, as statements in a knowledge base they are problematic as both contain implicit
information. The term ‘soon’ is relative to the rate of weed mortality on land, which is not
fallowed. This is clear enough in the source knowledge but not as an explicit statement of
ecological knowledge. Furthermore, in the second statement there is an implicit causality –
however the statement only really identifies the coincidence of weed die back and canopy
closure.
Interpretation might suggest that we should state instead that:
               Forest canopy closure causes weeds to die back
and
               Forest canopy closure occurs during the fallow period
Clearly this interpretation may require validation through further reference to the source
knowledge. However, the knowledge expressed here is more fundamental and more useful
than the above statements.
As a result of the interpretation involved, different sets of statements will be abstracted from
the same source knowledge by different people with different objectives. It is important to
realise that any abstraction of knowledge for representation in the knowledge base is open to
debate. There can be no single correct abstraction, although there can certainly be incorrect

ones. The statements in Table 14.1 are an example of one set of statements abstracted from
the text. These do not immediately and literally relate to the source knowledge but are
designed to capture its ecological content. Some statements are speculative and demand
validation while others can be expressed with more confidence.
Table 14.1 Example set of statements abstracted from the text
Burning causes a decrease in numbers of pests
Burning causes a decrease in crop disease levels
Clearing causes an increase in soil temperature
An increase in soil temperature causes an increase in the rate of decomposition of organic
matter
Nutrient availability is high for two years after burning
Harvesting causes a reduction in soil nutrient levels
Leaching causes a reduction in soil nutrient levels
A reduction in soil nutrient levels causes a reduction in soil fertility
An increase in weed density causes a decrease in crop yield
Soil erosion is not a problem IF the soil is always covered with some type of vegetation
Soil erosion is severe IF soil is not covered with vegetation
Soil erosion is very severe on hills
An increase in soil erosion causes an increase in the siltation of waterways
An increase in the siltation of waterways reduces fish production
Weeds are not a problem IF land is regularly fallowed
Canopy closure causes the death of weeds
14.3 ENTERING KNOWLEDGE INTO THE KNOWLEDGE
BASE
These statements can be entered into the knowledge base in two ways, through the Show
Kb Diagrams interface in the main Diagram menu or through the Statements dialog box in
the main KB menu.
14.3.1 ENTERING KNOWLEDGE THROUGH THE DIAGRAM INTERFACE
It is possible to enter all the statements in Table 14.1 into the knowledge base using the
statement card. Alternatively, all the causal and link statements can be entered through the
diagramming interface. We will start with the diagramming interface as this helps to ensure
unambiguous connections between the individual statements (which is very important if a
useful knowledge base is to result) and can be helpful to the beginner because statements
entered through the diagramming interface are formalised automatically.
As an example of the use of the diagram interface we will enter the statements abstracted
from the first paragraph of the text:
              “....burning helps to control pests and diseases ... the higher soil
              temperatures that follow clearing and burning also accelerate the
              decomposition of organic matter in the top layers of the soil.”
Under the Diagram menu select Show Kb Diagrams. This will give you a blank diagram
window with all the function buttons displayed on either side.
Entering a statement through the diagram interface demands some thought about the
structure of that statement. For full details of the diagramming syntax see Chapter 4, section
4.4. The section on formal representation (Chapter 4, section 4.2) will also clarify the
structures of statements supported.
The following five statements might be abstracted from this paragraph:
Tutorials                                         157
Chapter Fourteen – Tutorial in creating a simple knowledge base
                Table 14.2 Statements abstracted from the first paragraph:
                1)  Burning causes a decrease in pest numbers
                2)  Burning causes a decrease in disease levels
                3)  Clearing causes an increase in soil temperature
                4)  Burning causes an increase in soil temperature
                5)  An increase in soil temperature causes an increase in the rate of
                    decomposition of organic matter
Each of these statements can be represented in the diagramming interface as a pair of nodes
and a link between them. In the case of the first statement the two nodes are ‘burning’ –an
        1
action – and ‘number of pests’ – an attribute (number) of an object (pests). To represent this
statement;
     1. Select the Action button from the ‘Add node’ box on the left-hand side of the diagram
          screen.
     2. Move your cursor onto the drawing area and click to create an action node. A dialog
          box will appear, asking for details of the action.
     3. Enter the action name ‘burning’ and then look at the object boxes. (There are two
          options, ‘One Object’ or ‘Two Objects’. In this case it is an action without a specified
          object but as all actions are accompanied by objects it is necessary to refer to the
          object being burnt. In this case ‘site’ or ‘field’ could be used).
     4. Tick the ‘One Object’ box and enter ‘site’.
     5. Press OK. On the diagram screen a node appears bearing the legend ‘site burning’.
     6. Select the Attribute button from the ‘Add node’ box to create the second node. An
          ‘attribute_relation_dialog’ box appears. The attribute can relate to three things,
          objects, processes or actions. In this case it is related to an object (pests).
     7. Tick the ‘Object’ box.
     8. Press OK. An ‘attribute_object_dialog’ box then appears.
     9. Specify ‘number’ as the attribute and ‘pests’ as the object.
     10. Press OK.
     11. Now select the Link button from the ‘Add link’ box.
     12. Move the cursor to the ‘site burning’ node, left click and hold the mouse button down,
          drag the cursor to the ‘pests number’ node and release the mouse button.
     13. A ‘Choose Link’ dialog box now appears. In this case for ‘Link type’ choose
          ‘causes1way’ and for ‘Effect Value’ in the ‘Parameters’ box choose ‘decrease’.
     14. Press OK. The ‘Information Source’ dialog box now appears.....
14.3.1.a Entering the Information Source
No statement can be accepted by AKT without a source attached, so here goes...
     1. In the ‘New’ box, select the Reference radio button and then press New. The dialog
          box ‘Create a new reference source’ appears.
     2. Fill in the details of the authors, the name of the journal title and the name of the
                                                              2
          article as given at the beginning of this chapter .
     3. When you have completed filling in the details of the dialog box, press Save.
     4. The statements sources dialog box reappears with the source highlighted. Press OK.

  ‘Burning’ can be either a process or an action. If it is used as a management tool, it is an
action, otherwise it is a process. In any knowledge base it can only be used as one or the
other, it cannot be entered as both action and process. If some statements also refer to
burning brought about by natural causes then another term must be found, either ‘fire’ as an
object, or ‘conflagration’ as a process.

  In the case of an article, the name of the journal should go in the ‘Name’ box.

      5. The screen now automatically brings up the ‘New Statement’ dialog box, giving both
         the formal language representation and the natural language representation of the
         nodes and link created in the diagram interface. Press Save.
      6. The following message will then appear: “Are you sure you want to save this
         statement without a condition?” In this case the answer is ‘yes’ so press Yes.
      7. Dialog boxes will then appear, asking if you wish to create new formal terms for the
         various terms just entered. Press Yes on each occasion.
The screen then reverts to the diagram interface and displays the two nodes connected by a
link.
Try entering the other four statements via the Diagram interface. Note that ‘clearing’, like
‘burning’, is an action and therefore needs an object. In this case as well, ‘site’ would be a
valid object.
After entering the first 5 statements, and pressing Label Mode on the right hand side of the
screen twice to get the full statements, you should end up with a diagram something like
Figure 14.1.
Figure 14.1 Diagram constructed from the statements in Table 12.2
This example illustrates one of the most important features of the diagramming approach: the
way that it helps you to identify ambiguity in the knowledge being represented. While the five
statements individually appear reasonably intuitive, their combination into a diagram suggests
that important information is missing. Burning will certainly raise soil temperatures but it is
likely that the warming of the soil referred to in the text is not actually a direct consequence of
burning but of the removal of vegetation as a result of burning and the consequent increase in
insolation. Modification of the above diagram may better capture this interpreted meaning
(see Figure 14.2 below).

14.3.2 ENTERING KNOWLEDGE THROUGH THE STATEMENT CARD
Although statements entered through the diagram interface are formalised automatically, any
statements entered through the statement card must be formalised manually. The process of
formal representation requires some practice. Read through Chapter 4 (part 4.2), which takes
you through formal representation step by step, then try to formalise the extracted statements
given in Table 14.1. Table 14.3 gives a formal version for each of the statements in Table
14.1. There are no definitive, correct answers in formal representation, although there are
certainly incorrect ones.

               will have to be entered again.
14.4 PLAYING WITH THE KNOWLEDGE BASE
Now that you have created a mini knowledge base, the following section gives you
suggestions on ways in which to enhance its usefulness and to explore it. In each section are
numbers, underlined and in brackets. These are the chapters and paragraphs to which you
should refer for instructions on how to carry out the tasks.
Tutorials                                        161
Chapter Fourteen – Tutorial in creating a simple knowledge base
# Defining formal terms (7.4.3.a)
You should always take care to define your formal terms clearly. Even simple terms should
be defined as two people may understand something quite different under the same term.
For example the action ‘clearing’ could mean clearing of undergrowth, clearing of weeds or
complete clearing of a site. Let us assume that in this case ‘clearing’ means ‘the complete
removal of vegetation from the site’:
    1. Go to the main KB menu.
    2. Select Formal Terms.
    3. In the ‘Type’ box select ‘action’.
    4. Highlight clearing and press Details. You can now enter the definition into the
         definition box.
    5. Press Save.
# Creating an object hierarchy (7.5.1)
You should wherever possible, structure the objects to identify any hierarchical relationships
between them. The creation of object hierarchies allows you to develop a compact
knowledge base because they allow knowledge to be recorded at its most general level of
application, yet be used to consider more specific instances.
Two of the objects in the knowledge base you are creating here vegetation and crops
clearly can be hierarchically associated. Furthermore, it is obvious from the source text that
beans, cassava, corn, plantains, rice and yams are types of crop.
    1. Select Object Hierarchies in the main KB menu.
    2. Select New.
    3. In the ‘New Hierarchy Name’ box, enter a name for the object hierarchy. You can
         either enter a name of your own choosing, (in this case we have called the hierarchy
         ‘plants’), or select an object from the ‘KB objects’ list to act as the hierarchy name.
    4. Press Save. The hierarchy name ‘plants’ now appears in the ‘Object Hierarchies’ list
         in the ‘Object Hierarchies’ dialog box.
#     Appending objects to the object hierarchy
    1. Highlight the name of your new Object Hierarchy.
    2. In the ‘Selected Object’ box press Append to. A list of all the objects in the
         knowledge base then appears.
    3. Select ‘vegetation’.
    4. Press Append. The formal term ‘vegetation’ then appears in the object hierarchy
         ‘plants’ as an immediate sub-object of ‘plants’.
# Building up object hierarchies (7.5.3.)
Add the following statements to your knowledge base
              Beans fix nitrogen
              Corn does not fix nitrogen
              Rice does not fix nitrogen
Now practise creating another level in the ‘plants’ object hierarchy:
    1. Highlight vegetation, so that it appears in the ‘Object’ box of the ‘Hierarchy Structure’
         section.
    2. Press Append To.
    3. In the ‘Append Object’ dialog box, select ‘crops’ from the ‘Objects’ list and press
         Append.
    4. You now have an object hierarchy in which the formal term ‘vegetation’ has the
         parent ‘plants’ and the child ‘crops’.
Tutorials                                        162
Chapter Fourteen – Tutorial in creating a simple knowledge base
     5. Try incorporating ‘beans’, ‘corn’ and ‘rice’ in the object hierarchy ‘plants’ as
         subobjects of ‘crops’ by highlighting ‘crops’ so that it appears in the ‘Object’ box of the
         ‘Hierarchy Structure’ section and then pressing Append To.
     6. Continue as above.
The principal advantage of the hierarchy you have just created is that it can now be
recognised during reasoning that because:
              Soil erosion is not a problem if the soil is always covered with some
              type of vegetation
and
              Rice is a type of vegetation
(information from the hierarchy) then:
              soil erosion on a site covered in rice should not be a problem.
# Conducting an Boolean Search (7.10.1)
A knowledge base may often contain many hundreds of statements (see for example, the
knowledge base ‘treefodd’). Consequently, exploring the contents of a large knowledge base
through Statements in the main KB menu, or even via the Diagram interface becomes very
demanding and confusing. However, AKT contains a Boolean Search facility that allows you
to retrieve sets of statements that correspond to particular criteria.
Practise searching on an object using the Boolean Search:
     1.  Select Boolean Search from the main KB menu.
     2.  From the ‘Display Kb terms of type’ drop-down menu select ‘object’.
     3.  From the list of objects displayed, highlight crops and press Select.
     4.  The term crops will appear in the ‘Boolean Search String’ at the bottom of the dialog
         box. Press Search.
     5. A ‘Search Results’ dialog box then appears, giving all the statements retrieved
         containing the formal term ‘crops’.
#     Boolean searches using and and/or or (7.10.1.a)
Boolean searches can include combinations of formal terms linked with and and/or or. Try it
out on the formal terms pests and disease
     6.  Select Boolean Search from the main KB menu.
     7.  From the ‘Display Kb terms of type’ drop-down menu select ‘object’.
     8.  From the list of objects displayed, highlight pests and press Select.
     9.  The term pests will appear in the ‘Boolean Search String’ at the bottom of the dialog
         box.
     10. Press the OR button from the ‘Boolean Options’ box.
     11. Now find the term ‘disease’, highlight it and press Select.
     12. In the ‘Boolean Search String’ at the bottom of the dialog box should be ‘pests or
         disease’. Now press Search.
     13. You will be presented with all the statements in your knowledge base containing
         either the term ‘disease’ or the term ‘pests’.
     14. If you repeat this process but select the term AND instead of OR, no statements will
         be found as there are no statements in the knowledge base which contain both the
         term ‘disease’ and the term ‘pests’.
When undertaking searches combining ‘and’ and ‘or’ it is necessary to use brackets as one
does in algebra to give the order of precedence in the search. Experiment with ‘burning’ and
‘pests’ or ‘burning’ and ‘disease’. To get all the statements mentioning either ‘burning’ and
‘pests’ or ‘burning’ and ‘disease’ the Boolean Search String should include brackets, thus:

               (burning and pests) or (burning and disease)
The searches which we have practised so far have retrieved only statements that contain the
specified formal term. However, because we have additional information about object terms
in the form of the hierarchies, we can use alternative search strategies.
In the ‘Search Options’ box, it is possible to select:
               1) ‘object’,
               2) ‘superobject’
               3) ‘subobjects’
in any combination.
Now try out all the different search options, one at a time. The first option will give you only
the statements containing the word ‘crops’. The second option will give you all the statements
containing ‘crops’ or any of the subobjects, ‘rice’, ‘beans’ or ‘corn’. The third option will give
you all the statements containing any of the objects in the object hierarchy ‘plants’.
#     Creating Topics (7.11.1)
You may wish to save a particular Boolean Search String to create a permanent subset of
statements in your knowledge base. These subsets of knowledge are called Topics and are
created in the same way as any Boolean Search String, the difference being that they are
then saved as a topic.
Try creating a topic entitled ‘management actions’, from a Boolean Search String containing
the terms ‘burning’ or ‘clearing’ or ‘harvesting’.
     1. Create the Boolean Search String.
     2. In the box marked ‘Name of new topic’ type in management actions.
     3. Now press Save in the ‘Save search selection’ box.
     4. In the Topic Details box press Save once more.
Go to Topics via the main KB menu and select management actions. When the Search
Results appear, try out the different buttons on the ‘Diagram Selection Type’ at the bottom of
the dialog box (7.10.1.c)
#      DIAGRAM GENERATION (8)
Diagramming was used earlier in the tutorial as a means of creating a knowledge base. You
can also use diagramming as a means of exploring the content of a knowledge base.
     1. Open the diagram interface (by selecting the Diagram from the main menu).
     2. Try to build up sub diagrams by using the Show Paths (8.3.1), Navigate (8.3.2.)
         and the Cause and Effect (8.3.3.) buttons.
     3. Move between the different diagrams (8.5)
     4. Give each diagram a different label (8.6.1.).
                                                  2
               Simple attribute value statements and comparison statements cannot
               be represented in a diagram.
#     Printing diagrams (8.11)
You may want to print a diagram to illustrate a point – just press Print Window on the right
hand side of the diagram screen. Or if you want to transfer it to anther package before
printing it out, press Copy to Clipboard (8.6.3)

# Printing Statements (7.13)
Often it may be useful to print out some of the content of the knowledge base in order to help
you in its exploration. Or you may wish to save your statements to another package and print
them out from there. Try printing out all the statements in your Topic ‘management actions’;
     1.   Select the main KB menu.
     2.   Select Topics.
     3.   Select ‘management actions’.
     4.   Press Search.
     5.   Print the Print Statements button at the bottom of the ‘Search Results’ dialog box.
     6.   Try printing the statements directly and try saving them as a text file as well.
#     USING TOOLS (9 and 10)
As this is a tutorial for beginners and the knowledge base ‘slash and burn’ is only very small,
you would not normally need the tools at this stage. However, just to give you a little taster of
what tools can do, here are two for you to try out.
The following is a little exercise to introduce you to some of the tools and what they do. To
get started select the main Tools menu and then press Tools, Systems Tools and finally
Knowledge Evaluation.
1. The tool kb_report(Kb) gives you a summary of the categories of statements in your
     knowledge base. Press Run. A dialog box appears, requesting the name of the
     knowledge base. Enter the name of your knowledge base and press Continue. The tool
     output will give you the following output;
               Total number of statements          22 of which 5 are conditional.
               Number of attribute statements       5 of which 5 are conditional.
               Number of causal statements          14 of which 0 are conditional.
               Number of comparison statements 0 of which 0 are conditional.
               Number of link statements             3 of which 0 are conditional.
Remaining within the Systems Tools category, go to Knowledge Exploration.
2. The tool species_report/2 extracts information from the knowledge base about a
                          3
     particular species . Press Run. An input parameter dialog box appears requesting the
     name of the knowledge base and of the species to be extracted. Enter the name of your
     knowledge base and enter ‘crops’ in the ‘species’ box. Then press Continue. You should
     get the following output;
Kb        = slash_and_burn
Species = crops
INFORMATION SHEET FOR : crops
HIERARCHY :          plants
   vegetation
   crops
ATTRIBUTE STATEMENTS :
   none
CAUSAL STATEMENTS :
harvesting of crops causes a decrease in level of soil nutrients
COMPARISON STATEMENTS :
   none
LINK STATEMENTS              :
3
  Species in this context can mean any object in the knowledge base.

Chapter Fourteen – Tutorial in creating a simple knowledge base
   none
CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS :
   none
DERIVED STATEMENTS :
 the erosion of soil rate is minimal if crops covers soil
 the rate of erosion of soil is high if crops not_covers soil
burning of site causes removal of crops
removal of crops causes an increase in level of insolation of soil
This tool not only tells you all about the selected ‘species’ (in this case ‘crops’) but it also
gives you all the statements derived via the object hierarchy as well.
#     CLOSING YOUR KNOWLEDGE BASE (7.14)
Now has come the time to close your knowledge base. Before closing it, you must decide if
you want to save the changes you have made to it or not.
If you do wish to save the changes, then select Save KB or Save KB As from the main KB
menu. Once you have saved the knowledge base, select Close KB from the main KB menu.
                                                  1
                                   If you decide to change or edit the
                                name of any knowledge base, it must
                                only be done from within AKT via the
                                 Save KB As option. If it is done any
                                other way then AKT will not be able to
                                  load the knowledge base correctly.
If you do not wish to save the changes you have made, then go straight to Close KB. Once
you have closed the knowledge base go to the main File menu and click on Exit AKT.
                          YOUR TUTORIAL IS AT AN END
   THE CHALLENGE IS NOW TO MAKE A KNOWLEDGE BASE
                                        OF YOUR OWN!
